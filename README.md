# AI-Powered-Jira-Ticket-Summarizer-Prioritizer

# Project Overview : 
This end-to-end solution leverages advanced NLP, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to automate the summarization and prioritization of Jira tickets. Built in Google Colab, the pipeline transforms raw ticket data into actionable insights, enabling faster triage, smarter resource allocation, and enhanced operational efficiency. The system integrates extractive summarization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and predictive modeling to support data-driven decision-making in agile environments.

# Key Objectives : 
Automatically summarize Jira tickets using extractive NLP techniques.
Analyze sentiment and linguistic complexity to infer urgency.
Predict ticket priority using ML and DL models.
Visualize insights through interactive dashboards for business impact.
